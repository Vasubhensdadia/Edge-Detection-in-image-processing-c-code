# Edge Detection in image processing
Here code is written in c language.

We had to design a C project to read an image into
a matrix. After reading the image, we had to break
the image into equal sized patches, and identify
the most important patches based on their
content.

in this project, We have to make this possible without using any libraries. 

Three steps : 
1. Gaussian Blur,
2. Sobel Operator,
3. Canny Operator

Constraint:
1. Input image file must in bmp file.     format.
2. When code is running, you should've    to enter no. of patches. No. of.       patch you enter must be divisible.     by no. of pixels in row and column     both(size of image).
